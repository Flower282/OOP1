1.Advantages of Polymorphism:
	Promotes code reusability and flexibility.
	Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
	Makes code easier to extend and maintain.

2.How Inheritance Helps Achieve Polymorphism in Java:
	Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit methods from a superclass.
	Polymorphism is achieved when a subclass overrides these methods, and objects are accessed through a reference of the superclass type.

3.Differences Between Polymorphism and Inheritance:
	Inheritance is a mechanism to acquire properties and behaviors from another class.
	Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types or method implementations.
	Inheritance is about structure; polymorphism is about behavior.
